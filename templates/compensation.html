        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
          Unilever has recalled its aerosol dry shampoo products such as Dove, Tresemme, etc. due to the presence of
          carcinogenic content. The product recall meaning calling the products from the market immediately. It's not a
          new thing. Earlier, we have seen many product recalls by big companies from the market due to various reasons
          from Nestle India to Starbucks, Ikea to Volkswagen. Here are some interesting product recalls by big brands
          from the market to avoid a disaster and ensue controversy they faced.
