        <h3><b>Types of breast cancer</b></h3>
        Breast cancer can be invasive or non-invasive. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that spreads into surrounding tissues and/or distant organs. Non-invasive breast cancer does not go beyond the milk ducts or lobules in the breast. There are multiple types of breast cancers, which are classified based on how they look under a microscope.

        <h3><b>Ductal carcinoma.</b></h3> <br>  
        This is the most common type of breast cancer.


        <h3><b>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).</b></h3> <br> 
        This is a non-invasive cancer (stage 0) that is located only in the duct and has not spread outside the duct.<br>
        

        <h3><b>Invasive or infiltrating ductal carcinoma.</b></h3> <br> 
        This is cancer that has spread outside of the ducts or lobules.<br>
           
        <h3><b>Invasive lobular carcinoma. </b></h3> <br> 
        This is a less commonly occurring type of breast cancer that has spread outside of the ducts or lobules.
