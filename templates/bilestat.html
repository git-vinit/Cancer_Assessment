        <h3><b>Statistic of bile duct cancer</b></h3>
        Primary bile duct cancer is uncommon in the United States. Each year, an estimated 8,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with bile duct cancer. The average age at diagnosis for people with intrahepatic bile duct cancer is 70 years. For extrahepatic bile duct cancer, the average age at diagnosis is 72.
        <br>
        In some parts of the world, a parasite called a liver fluke can infect the bile duct and cause cancer. Liver flukes are very common in Southeast Asia, and bile duct cancer is more common in this part of the world. Also, gallstones and inflammatory conditions of the digestive tract, such as ulcerative colitis or an associated condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), increase the risk of bile duct cancer. PSC is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks the bile ducts and causes scarring. See the Risk Factors and Prevention section for more information.
        <br>
        The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for extrahepatic bile duct cancer is 10%. If the cancer is diagnosed in an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 17%. If the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 16%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 2%.
        <br>
        The 5-year survival rate for intrahepatic bile duct cancer is 9%. If the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 25%. If the cancer has spread to the regional lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 8%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 2%.
